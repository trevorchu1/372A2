            <p>
                Patagonia is a magical destination for nature lovers. Torres del Paine National Park in Chile offers some of the most breathtaking hiking trails in the world. Be warned, the hikes are multi-day treks, so plan accordingly!
                In Argentina, the Los Glaciares National Park is home to the world famous Perito Moreno Glacier, which is one of the few glaciers in the world that is still growing.

                If you're planning for Perito Moreno, your launch point may be El Calafate, a small town with a lively center and plenty of steakhouses!
